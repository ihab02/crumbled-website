## Implementation Plan

- [x] **Backend: Resend Verification API**
  - [x] Create `app/api/auth/resend-verification/route.ts`.
  - [x] Accept a POST request with the user‚Äôs email.
  - [x] Check if the user exists and is not verified.
  - [x] If already verified, return a generic success.
  - [x] If not verified, check for an existing, unexpired token. If found, reuse it; otherwise, generate a new token.
  - [x] Send a new verification email with the token using a pastel, bakery-themed template.
  - [x] Always return a generic success message to avoid email enumeration.

- [x] **Frontend: Login Page**
  - [x] When login fails with the ‚Äúnot verified‚Äù error, show a **‚ÄúResend Verification Email‚Äù** button.
  - [x] On click, call the new API endpoint with the user‚Äôs email.
  - [x] Show a toast/message for success or failure.
  - [x] Disable the button while the request is in progress.

- [x] **Email Template**
  - [x] Use a pastel, bakery-themed template for the verification email.
  - [x] The button links to `/auth/verify-email?token=...`.
