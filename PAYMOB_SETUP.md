# Paymob Payment Integration Setup

This guide explains how to set up Paymob payment integration for the Crumbled website.

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### 1. Environment Variables

Add the following variables to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Paymob Configuration (Redirect Flow)
PAYMOB_API_KEY=your_paymob_api_key_here
PAYMOB_INTEGRATION_ID=your_integration_id_here
PAYMOB_BASE_URL=https://accept.paymob.com/api
# PAYMOB_IFRAME_ID=optional_for_redirect_flow
```

**Note:** For redirect flow (recommended), you only need the API key and integration ID. The iframe ID is optional and only needed if you want to embed the payment form in an iframe.

### 2. Paymob Account Setup

1. **Create Paymob Account**: Sign up at [Paymob](https://paymob.com)
2. **Get API Key**: From your Paymob dashboard
3. **Create Integration**: Set up a payment integration
4. **Get Integration ID**: Copy the integration ID from your dashboard
5. **Get Iframe ID** (Optional): Only needed if you want to embed the payment form in an iframe. For redirect flow, this is not required.

## ï¿½ï¿½ Payment Flow

### 1. User Selects Paymob Payment
- User chooses "Pay with Paymob" in checkout
- System creates order in database with "Unpaid" status

### 2. Paymob Order Creation
- System calls Paymob API to create order
- Paymob returns order ID

### 3. Payment Key Generation
- System generates payment key with billing data
- Paymob returns payment token

### 4. Redirect to Paymob

- **Redirect Flow URL**: `https://accept.paymob.com/api/acceptance/payments/pay?payment_token={token}`
- **Iframe Flow URL**: `https://accept.paymob.com/api/acceptance/iframes/{iframe_id}?payment_token={token}`

### 5. Payment Processing
